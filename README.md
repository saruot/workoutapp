My thoughts on making this project:

The file structure could've been better. I implemented this project into my previous experimental project, where I already had my navigation setup so I wouldn't have to do it again.
For refrence, definetly would not do this again. Added unnececssary problems and confusion with ghost files being in the project that were not used at all.

File structure:
Everything probably should not have been inside the root folder 'components'. Think a better file structure would be to have root folders for components, screens, and functions seperately.
Stylesheets should have been made more clearly, and commented clearly. Also probably good to indicate in the style sheets where they are being used for what purpouse.

Unresolved issues:
Only one, I could not get the scrolling to work on the AddWorkout screen for the workout list. Also could not figure a way to anchor the 'View all workouts' Button to the bottom of the screen.
Inital idea was to have a scrollable list of 5 workouts on the main screen, with the rest of them on the workout list screen, but my solution around these problems was just having the newest two
show up on the main screen.

Conclusion:
The project was fun, I enjoyed working on the mobile view and with react. Definetly learned alot about mobile programming, seeing as this was my first project.
